# Project: Astrological Event Forecaster
# Monitor Placement: Top Middle - Landscape (Deeper)
# Theme: Divine Timing - Aligning trading actions with celestial rhythms for synchronicity.

# Greater Purpose:
# To leverage the cosmic rhythms of planetary alignments and transits for actionable insights in market timing.
# The tool empowers decision-making aligned with the universe's cycles, enhancing synchronicity and precision.

# Why We Need This:
# 1. To dynamically calculate Galactic Center Ayanamsa and adjust for the precession of the equinox in real-time.
# 2. To operate entirely offline using a comprehensive preloaded ephemeris for second-to-second calculations.
# 3. To provide a clear and detailed visualization of planetary alignments and their financial implications.
# 4. To integrate astrophysical rigor with ancient metaphysical wisdom, bridging universal timing with practical action.

# Functionality Overview:

1. **Dynamic Ayanamsa Calculation**:
   - Uses Galactic Center (0Â° Sagittarius) as the reference point.
   - Adjusts for the precession of the equinox dynamically, calculated in real-time.

2. **Offline Ephemeris Management**:
   - Preloaded, comprehensive ephemeris dataset (e.g., DE430/DE440) for planetary positions and orbital data.
   - Supports second-to-second precision with interpolation for real-time calculations.

3. **Astrophysical Calculations**:
   - Incorporates velocity, acceleration, perturbations, and node positions.
   - Dynamically calculates Lots (e.g., Part of Fortune, Lot of Wealth) and planetary aspects.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Zodiac wheel showing planetary positions, nodes, and Lots.
   - Timeline of upcoming transits with markers for critical alignments.
   - Updates dynamically, reflecting precession and real-time planetary movement.

5. **Market Recommendations**:
   - Provides actionable suggestions based on astrological events.
   - Highlights optimal trading windows, caution periods, and significant alignments.

6. **Customization**:
   - User-defined filters for events (e.g., include/exclude retrogrades).
   - Adjustable thresholds for transits and alignments based on significance.

# Dataset Considerations for Offline Functionality:

1. **Preloaded Ephemeris**:
   - Sources: DE430/DE440, Swiss Ephemeris.
   - Data required:
     - Planetary positions.
     - Orbital parameters (semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, etc.).
     - Nodes (Apogee, Perigee, North/South Nodes).

2. **Data Management**:
   - Format: `.csv`, `.json`, or `.eph`.
   - Strategy:
     - Load data incrementally to minimize memory overhead.
     - Use interpolation for high-frequency calculations.

3. **Update Mechanism**:
   - Optional manual script for updating ephemeris datasets offline.

# Detailed Mathematical Framework:

1. **Dynamic Ayanamsa Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Ayanamsa}_{\text{Galactic}} = 27^\circ + \frac{50.29}{3600} \times t
   \]
   - \(t\): Time elapsed in seconds from the epoch.

2. **Planetary Position Interpolation**:
   \[
   r(t) = r_1 + \frac{(r_2 - r_1)}{(t_2 - t_1)} \times (t - t_1)
   \]

3. **Planetary Aspects**:
   - Aspect angle:
     \[
     \text{Aspect Angle} = |\text{Longitude}_1 - \text{Longitude}_2|
     \]
   - Match with thresholds:
     - Conjunction: \(0^\circ\)
     - Opposition: \(180^\circ\)
     - Square: \(90^\circ\), etc.

4. **Lot Calculations**:
   - **Part of Fortune (Day Chart)**:
     \[
     P_f = \text{ASC} + \text{Moon} - \text{Sun}
     \]
   - **Part of Fortune (Night Chart)**:
     \[
     P_f = \text{ASC} + \text{Sun} - \text{Moon}
     \]

5. **Velocity and Acceleration**:
   - Orbital velocity:
     \[
     v = \sqrt{G \times \frac{M}{r}}
     \]
   - Acceleration:
     \[
     a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
     \]

6. **Perturbation Effects**:
   \[
   \Delta r = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{G \times m_i}{r^2}
   \]

7. **Node Calculations**:
   - Apogee:
     \[
     r_a = a \times (1 + e)
     \]
   - Perigee:
     \[
     r_p = a \times (1 - e)
     \]

8. **Event Weighting**:
   - Weight for event significance:
     \[
     W = S \times (1 - d/D)
     \]
     - \(S\): Significance score of the event.
     - \(d\): Days until the event.
     - \(D\): Total time window.
