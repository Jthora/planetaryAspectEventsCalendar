    - astrological_aspects_market_analysis_behavior
    - astrological_aspects_market_analysis_action
    - planetary_context
    - planetary_behavior
    - planetary_action
    - planetary_context_interactions
    - planetary_behavior_interactions
    - planetary_action_recommendations
    - planetary_risk_management
    - asc_dsc_mc_ic_meaning
    - asc_dsc_mc_ic_actions
    - asc_dsc_mc_ic_risk_management
    - meanings_planets_in_zodiac
    - actions_planets_in_zodiac
    - risk_management_planets_in_zodiac
    - meanings_planets_nodes
    - actions_planets_nodes
    - risk_management_planets_nodes
    - meanings_planets_lunar_nodes
    - actions_planets_lunar_nodes
    - risk_management_planets_lunar_nodes
    - meanings_houses_zodiac
    - actions_houses_zodiac
    - risk_management_houses_zodiac
    - planets_to_houses_actions
    - parts_lots_meaning
    - parts_lots_action
    - parts_lots_risk_management
    - planet_transits_meanings
    - planet_transits_actions
    - planet_transits_risk_management

2. Define core data structures:
    - `planets`: List of all planets (e.g., Sun, Moon, Mercury, etc.).
    - `zodiac_signs`: List of zodiac signs in sequential order.
    - `houses`: List of astrological houses (1 to 12).
    - `transits`: Planetary movements from one zodiac sign or house to another.

3. Define user preferences:
    - `user_focus`: Planets, aspects, or specific transits to monitor.
    - `user_goals`: Objectives like "high risk/high reward" or "conservative trading."

#### Main Logic

##### Step 1: Input Handling
1. Accept user input:
    - Planets or aspects to monitor.
    - Transits, nodes, or lots of interest.
    - Trading preferences (e.g., risk tolerance).

2. Validate input against available dictionaries.
    - Ensure selected inputs exist in relevant dictionaries.

##### Step 2: Identify Active Astrological Events
1. Retrieve current astrological data (transits, aspects, etc.).
    - Example: Use ephemeris data or APIs.

2. For each active event:
    a. Check planetary transits using `planet_transits_meanings`.
    b. Cross-reference with:
        - `asc_dsc_mc_ic_meaning` for Ascendant/Descendant events.
        - `meanings_houses_zodiac` for house-based influences.
        - `parts_lots_meaning` for Parts/Lots meanings.

##### Step 3: Determine Market Analysis Context
1. For each identified event:
    a. Use `astrological_aspects_market_analysis_context` for broader trends.
    b. Retrieve behavior influences from `astrological_aspects_market_analysis_behavior`.
    c. Determine actions using `astrological_aspects_market_analysis_action`.

2. Combine data to form a complete market analysis context.

##### Step 4: Define Market Behavior
1. For each planet in user preferences:
    a. Use `planetary_behavior` for general tendencies.
    b. Cross-reference with `planetary_behavior_interactions` for interactions between planets.

2. Analyze specific planetary influences on nodes:
    a. Retrieve data from `meanings_planets_nodes`.
    b. Use `actions_planets_nodes` for recommended actions.
    c. Incorporate risk management strategies from `risk_management_planets_nodes`.

##### Step 5: Generate Actionable Recommendations
1. Match planetary transits to `planet_transits_actions`.
    - Include zodiac-based actions from `actions_planets_in_zodiac`.

2. Incorporate house-based actions using `actions_houses_zodiac`.

3. For Parts/Lots:
    - Use `parts_lots_action` for specific trade recommendations.

4. Cross-reference with `planetary_action_recommendations` for best practices.

5. Adjust for risk using:
    a. `planetary_risk_management`.
    b. `risk_management_planets_in_zodiac`.
    c. `risk_management_houses_zodiac`.

##### Step 6: Present the Forecast
1. Create a structured output:
    - Summary of astrological trends.
    - Specific recommendations for trading actions.
    - Risk management guidelines.

2. Example format:
    - Event: "Venus transit from Taurus to Gemini"
        - Market Context: "Short-term volatility with speculative opportunities."
        - Recommended Actions: "Trade short-term opportunities influenced by news shifts."
        - Risk Management: "Verify all signals to avoid unreliable data."

##### Step 7: Automation
1. Schedule periodic updates:
    - Use Replit AI Agent to fetch and analyze data at intervals.

2. Automate notifications for significant events:
    - Set alerts for high-impact transits or aspects.

#### Advanced Features
1. Incorporate Machine Learning:
    - Train models on historical data and outcomes to refine forecasts.

2. Create Visualizations:
    - Map transits to market trends using charts and graphs.

3. Integrate API for real-time trading:
    - Link astrological forecasts with cryptocurrency trading platforms.
