FUNCTION CorrelateAstrologyAndMarket(astrologyData, marketData, analysisParams):
    INPUT: 
        astrologyData - Processed astrological data with timestamps, events, and types.
        marketData - Cryptocurrency market data with timestamps, price, volume, sentiment, etc.
        analysisParams - Configuration parameters (e.g., time granularity, correlation threshold).

    OUTPUT:
        correlationReport - Insights on significant patterns, correlation scores, and actionable recommendations.

    STEP 1: Preprocess Data
        ALIGN astrologyData and marketData by timestamps based on analysisParams.timeGranularity.
        NORMALIZE datasets for compatibility:
            - Normalize price changes to percentage values.
            - Scale event impact scores to a standard range (e.g., 0-1).
            - Handle missing data by interpolation or exclusion.

    STEP 2: Weight Astrological Events
        FOR each event in astrologyData:
            ASSIGN baseImpact = pre-determined weight for event type (e.g., "Mars retrograde" = 0.8).
            ADJUST weight based on:
                - Historical recurrence and market impact.
                - Event combinations or overlaps (e.g., "Full Moon during Mars retrograde" = +0.2).
            ADD weightedImpact to event object.

    STEP 3: Analyze Market Metrics
        DEFINE key metrics to analyze:
            priceChange = calculatePercentageChange(marketData["price"])
            volumeSpike = calculateVolumeSpike(marketData["volume"])
            sentimentTrend = analyzeSentiment(marketData["sentiment"])
        CREATE feature set:
            features = [priceChange, volumeSpike, sentimentTrend]

    STEP 4: Perform Statistical Correlation
        SET significantPatterns = []
        FOR each event in astrologyData:
            DEFINE eventWindow = marketData within event timeframe.
            FOR each feature in features:
                CALCULATE correlationScore = computeCorrelation(eventWindow, feature)
                CALCULATE pValue = computePValue(eventWindow, feature)
                IF correlationScore > analysisParams.correlationThreshold AND pValue < 0.05:
                    ADD {
                        "Event": event.type,
                        "Feature": feature,
                        "Score": correlationScore,
                        "pValue": pValue,
                        "WeightedImpact": event.weightedImpact
                    } TO significantPatterns

    STEP 5: Identify Compound Patterns
        SET compoundPatterns = []
        FOR overlapping events in astrologyData:
            COMBINE their weightedImpact scores.
            CHECK if combined events align with significant market changes.
            IF significant correlation detected:
                ADD {
                    "CompoundEvent": combinedEvent,
                    "Feature": correlatedMetric,
                    "Score": combinedScore
                } TO compoundPatterns

    STEP 6: Generate Insights
        SET insights = []
        FOR each pattern in significantPatterns + compoundPatterns:
            IF pattern.Event == "Full Moon" AND pattern.Feature == "priceDrop":
                ADD "High probability of market reversal. Reduce exposure." TO insights
            ELSE IF pattern.Event == "Jupiter trine Sun" AND pattern.Feature == "priceIncrease":
                ADD "Bullish trend expected. Consider entering long positions." TO insights
            ELSE:
                ADD "Neutral impact. Monitor market for further signals." TO insights

    STEP 7: Visualize Data
        CREATE timelineVisualization:
            PLOT astrologyData events with weightedImpact on timeline.
            OVERLAY marketData metrics (price, volume, sentiment).
            MARK significant correlations with annotations.
        CREATE correlationHeatmap:
            SHOW correlation scores between events and market features.

    STEP 8: Backtest Historical Patterns
        SET backtestResults = []
        FOR each historicalEvent in astrologyData (past data):
            COMPARE event impact with market outcomes.
            CALCULATE accuracyMetrics = {
                "ROI": calculateROI(event, marketData),
                "HitRate": calculateHitRate(event, marketData)
            }
            ADD accuracyMetrics TO backtestResults

    STEP 9: Compile Correlation Report
        correlationReport = {
            "Summary": {
                "TotalEventsAnalyzed": COUNT(astrologyData),
                "SignificantPatterns": COUNT(significantPatterns),
                "CompoundPatterns": COUNT(compoundPatterns)
            },
            "DetailedFindings": significantPatterns + compoundPatterns,
            "Insights": insights,
            "Visualizations": [timelineVisualization, correlationHeatmap],
            "BacktestResults": backtestResults
        }

    RETURN correlationReport
